 This little progressbar is what I use for my Streamlabs "Donation Goal" and "Follower Goal" widgets
 It shows how far I am, while also keeping in check with offline gains (a single variable)

 INSTRUCTIONS:
 You may use this bar for yourself, tweak it somewhat, and I don't even need credit. It's a simple and small thing. Here's how to use it:
    - Login to your Streamlabs account at "https://streamlabs.com/dashboard"
    - Select "All Widgets" from the left menu
    - Go to either the "Donation Goal" or "Follower Goal" widget
    - Next to the "Manage Goal" tab you'll find "Settings". Click it.
    - All the way down below, tick "Enabled" for the "Enable Custom HTML/CSS" option
    - Paste the below HTML markup in the HTML field
    - In Codepen's "CSS" box, click on the arrow on the top-right, and select "View Compiled CSS", copy the content, and paste it in your Streamlab form under "CSS"
    - Copy the commented code at the bottom of Codepen's "JS" box into the "JS" field in Streamlabs
    - Everything should now work!
